<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A very filling, low-carb lasagna that uses cabbage leaves in place of lasagna noodles. We find it every bit as good if not better than lasagna with pasta.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated carrots</li>
        <li>4 ounces mushroom pieces</li>
        <li>1 pound canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 head cabbage</li>
        <li>24 ounces low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parsley</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups grated part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add carrots and mushrooms. Add tomatoes and break up using a fork. Add basil, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and nutmeg. Reduce heat and simmer meat sauce for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Immerse cabbage in the boiling water and carefully break off leaves. Cook until leaves are limp, about 3 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine cottage cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and oregano in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 9x13-inch baking pan with cooking spray and place a layer of cooked cabbage leaves flat in the bottom.</li>
        <li>Reserve 1/4 cup of meat sauce. Layer 1/2 the remaining sauce on top of the cabbage leaves in the baking pan. Layer 1/2 the cottage cheese mixture followed by 1/2 the mozzarella cheese. Add a second layer of cabbage leaves, followed by remaining 1/2 of meat sauce, remaining cottage cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle reserved 1/4 cup meat sauce on top and finish with 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
